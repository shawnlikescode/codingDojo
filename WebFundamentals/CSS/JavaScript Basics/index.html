            <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language JavaScriptis extremely popular for a carity of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allow maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node sever), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmattic control over them.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="subject">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are container for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffe, a varible holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These names are called identifiers. <span class="example">var x;</span></li>
                <li><span class="subject">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our varaible a value to hold. The assignment a value to a variable. <span class="example">var x = 10;</span></li>
                <li><span class="subject">Data Type</span> Data types are an important an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to now the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="example">true</span> or <span class="">false</span>; null - <span class="example">null</span>aka nothing; Number - <span class="example">42</span> or <span class="example"> 3.14159</span>; String - <span class="example">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>Array - <span class="example">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span>; and Object - <span class="example">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
                <li><span class="subject">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code black based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:<span class="example">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="example">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="example">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                </li>
                <li><span class="subject">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><span class="subject">Functions</span> Functions are an excapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an exmaple imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we scew the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
